# Troubleshooting

## Known Issues

### Problems from Unknown Files Appear in the Problems Tab
Errors and warnings appear twice in the "PROBLEMS" tab. They first appear for the BitBake files to which they belong, and then again for Bash or Python files with hash names (ex. 9dab97ca1ef2b71ea07d42d4609e9e54.py). As the first one is expected and desired, the second is not. This issue arises from the way we handle diagnostics (errors and warnings). See [Trade-offs on Diagnostics](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#trade-offs-on-diagnostics).

Unfortunately, the VS Code API does not offer a way to programmatically filter the "PROBLEMS" tab. However, manual filtering is still possible. Typing `!workspaceStorage` or `!workspaceStorage/**/yocto-project.yocto-bitbake/embedded-documents` (if more precision is needed) should filter out all these unwanted problems.

If this problem gets too annoying, consider activating the `bitbake.disableEmbeddedLanguagesFiles` setting.

### Tabs from Unknown Files Open and Close Quickly
While typing, tabs with hash names (ex. 9dab97ca1ef2b71ea07d42d4609e9e54.sh) might occasionally open in the tabs bar and then close shortly thereafter.  This occurs as a result of our method for handling diagnostics (errors and warnings). See [Trade-offs on Diagnostics](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#trade-offs-on-diagnostics).

We haven't found a way to prevent these tabs from opening, but we try to close them as quickly as possible.

If this problem gets too annoying, consider activating the `bitbake.disableEmbeddedLanguagesFiles` setting.

### files.trimTrailingWhitespace does not work on Python and Shell files
When the extension is activated, `files.trimTrailingWhiteSpace` is deactivated for Python and Shell documents because this option interferes with the handling of Python and Shell code in BitBake documents.

In the background, some Python and Shell documents are made in order to handle Python and Shell languages in BitBake files. These documents contain a lot of trailing whitespaces. If `files.trimTrailingWhiteSpace` is activated, it will trim the whitespaces into these files, making it hard to map the positions between the generated files and the original BitBake file.

### BrokenPipeError on BitBake commands

If you are using a `bitbake.commandWrapper` that relies on docker containers, you may encounter the following errors:

```log
[Errno 32] Broken pipeTraceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/deribaucourt/Workspace/yocto-vscode/yocto/yocto-build/sources/poky/bitbake/lib/bb/ui/knotty.py", line 647, in main
    ret, error = server.runCommand(["ping"])
[...]
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/connection.py", line 368, in _send
    n = write(self._handle, buf)
BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/deribaucourt/Workspace/yocto-vscode/yocto/yocto-build/sources/poky/bitbake/bin/bitbake", line 36, in <module>
    sys.exit(bitbake_main(BitBakeConfigParameters(sys.argv),
[...]
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/connection.py", line 368, in _send
    n = write(self._handle, buf)
BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
```

```log
ERROR: Attempting to set server environment: bitbake-server might have died or been forcibly stopped, ie. OOM killed
```

These are due to a limitation of the bitbake server when running through containers in parallel. You'll get this error
when bitbake is started in multiple containers at the same time. To avoid this, wait for other bitbake processes to
finish before starting a new bitbake command. This extension won't allow concurrent commands, but you may have other
bitbake commands running in the background:
 - From a terminal
 - From another VSCode window
 - From another user session

### Parsing terminal reports an error but the parsing was successful

Prior to poky Scarthgap, a random bug may occur when parsing Yocto recipes through our BitBake commands, or
saving a file (Ctrl+S). This is due to VSCode sometimes saving files in the background while the parsing is
taking place in combination to a problematic handling of the progressbar in poky.

This issue is fixed in poky Scarthgap, but if you are using an older version, you may cherry-pick the following
commit to your poky repository:

### Settings are being ignored on Flake8 and Pylint
Settings for Flake8 and Pylint do not work on BitBake files. In other words, they are not configurable. The reason for this issue is currently unknown.

## Trade-offs

### Trade-offs on Diagnostics
Some functionalities for [embedded Bash and Python code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/embedded-languages) are provided by other VS Code extensions, such as ms-python.python or timonwong.shellcheck. To achieve this, we extract the Bash and Python content from the BitBake files and create temporary Bash or Python files that can be analyzed by Bash or Python extensions. We adapt the results of these extensions, and present them to the user. It works well for Completion, Definition and Hover. Unfortunately VS Code [does not yet offer such functionality for diagnostics](https://github.com/yoctoproject/vscode-bitbake/pull/18). We still achieve it by some homemade hacky technique that consists of opening the temporary documents in the background, in a way to trigger the generation of diagnostics. It brings a couple of issues, but we hope it is still worth having the diagnostics.

- [Tabs from Unknown Files Open and Close Quickly](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#tabs-from-unknown-files-open-and-close-quickly)

### Trade-offs on linting
Since Flake8 and Pylint are intended to be used on Python files, it is necessary to analyse the context in which the errors are generated to determine if they still apply to the BitBake file. Unfortunately, some errors require complex analysis and our experiments showed performance issues. For this reason, these errors are currently being completely ignored.

The linting errors being completely ignored:

Flake8:  
- E501 (Line too long)
- E203 (whitespace before ':')
- E211 (whitespace before '(')
- E302 (expected 2 blank lines, found 1)
- E303 (too many blank lines)

Pylint:  
- W0104:pointless-statement
- W0106:expression-not-assigned
